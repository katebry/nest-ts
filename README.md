# Restaurant Ordering Web App

This app creates a simple web api where restaurant users will be able to order food online. 

The following simple business rules apply:

1. Any User can see items on the menu
2. Only Identified Users can add items to their 'shopping cart' (the food order)
3. Only Admin Users may add new items to the menu
